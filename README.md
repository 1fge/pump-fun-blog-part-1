# Pump.fun Trading Strategy Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts used for analyzing and reverse-engineering a trading strategy on pump.fun, a platform where users can trade and create their own "meme coins." These scripts were written quickly for the purpose of analysis and are not production-level code. They served their purpose during our race to reverse-engineer the strategy and do not follow best practices for code quality.

## Disclaimer

**Important:**
- The scripts were designed to work with pump.fun’s API at the time of development. Pump.fun has likely made changes to their API since then, and these scripts may no longer function correctly.
- There is no guarantee that the trading strategy of the user known as orcACR has remained the same.
- These scripts are provided for archival purposes and are not intended to be used as a reliable trading tool.

## Purpose

The main objectives of these scripts were:
1. To fetch and store trading history data from pump.fun.
2. To analyze the trading patterns of orcACR and reverse-engineer their strategy.
3. To build backtest tables and simulate the performance of the strategy.
4. To identify conditions under which orcACR’s bot operated and evaluate its profitability.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection:** Scripts to fetch trading history from pump.fun’s API and store it in a MySQL database.
- **Analysis:** Scripts to analyze the trading data, build profiles of coin trades, and evaluate trading profitability.
- **Backtesting:** Scripts to create backtesting tables and simulate the performance of the identified trading strategy.

## Conclusion

These scripts provide a historical snapshot of how we reverse-engineered a trading strategy on pump.fun and built our analysis and backtesting framework. They are shared here as an archive and a reference for how the project was conducted.
